# Pets Store

1. This kata is done using Vue 3 and Vite. To run the project,
   ```shell
   npm i -g pnpm@latest
   # or `yarn global add pnpm@latest` if you use yarn
   
   # install packages
   pnpm i
   # runs the project on http://localhost:3000
   pnpm dev
   ```
2. This was done solely with Composition API that was released together with Vue 3. The internal reactivity features that Vue 3 exposes are great tools for approaching the task with reactive programming concepts.
